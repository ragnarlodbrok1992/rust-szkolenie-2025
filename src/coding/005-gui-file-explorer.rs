// Implement simple file explorer in GUI framework (ex. Iced)
// 1. Open a new window where user inputs (or selects) path he/she wants to view.
// 2. List all directories and files inside the directory.
// 3. Using mouse allow to move up/down paths/directories.
// 4. While clicking on a file display basic information about it (size/name/format).
